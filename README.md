# linux_configs
Contains configs for DWM, ST, Sxhkd

This runs on a machine that runs gentoo without a login manager. Use at own risk.
Sxhkd is used for keybinds since this is much easier to configure

# DWM Patches Used
Dwmblocks - Highly configurable status bar using C language

Layouts - CenteredMaster, CenteredTitle

CycleLayouts - Easy changing of layouts

ScratchPad - Great for using terminal and ranger fm on the go

RestartSig- Restart DWM after compilation without logging out of startx
